0:02:51            Influencers in your spheres can be a good way to market your product.

0:03:33            Team Communication
1. Email - only email with your team when necessary as it consumes a lot out of your time and it takes 16 minutes for us to get back on track after an email.
2. Email Alternatives - can we do this in person, in a quick meeting, comment through PM software, or a quick message over at Slack.
3. Project Management tools - make sure your To-dos are not in your email but in your PM tools.

Always make sure you are using the right tool for the thing you're discussing or talking about. Think twice before you CC someone or send them a message.
